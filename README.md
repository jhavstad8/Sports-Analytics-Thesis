# Sports Analytics Thesis
This repository contains information that I, Josh Havstad, have collected throughout my thesis research into sports analytics education. 
This information is meant to help instructors and students of sports analytics courses, with the hopes of furthering education in the field.
Through online research and the help of the sports analytics community, I have course syllabi, textbooks and readings, lessons and assignments, data sources/sets, and more.
I would like to thank everyone who assisted me in this process, especially everyone who reached out in response to my listserv through CAUSE and provided helpful resources.
Some resources you will find in this repository include:
* a folder with PDFs of sports analytics course syllabi from various universities
* a table of helpful textbooks and readings to use in a potential sports analytics course
* a table of potential lessons and assignments to use for various sports analytics topics and related readings
* a table of data sets and valuable websites with sports data for students to use
* a table of sports analytics courses from various universities and their prerequisites, materials, websites, and difficulty level
* a table with miscellaneous resourcs that either were recommended to me or that I came across through my research
* a pdf of my recommended course proposal for an advanced, undergraduate sports analytics course at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo
